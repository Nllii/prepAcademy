proof of concept apis(endpoints) and backend for prepAcademy
REST on flask 

# DOCUMENTATION (Alpha version 0.0.1)

```payment_data api request to the server```
- ```payment_id (generated by the server and mapped to the user)```
- ```payment_amount```
- ```payment_date```
- ```payment_status```
- ```payment_type```
- ```payment_currency```

1. ```findAccount``` checks if the user exists in the database. In the future, this will be replaced by an actual database; not file storage.
response dictionary:
```bash
"account_number": "",
"created_at": "",
"last_login": "",
"username": "",
"password": "",
"email": "",
"date_of_birth": "",
"first_name": "",
"last_name": "",
"address": "",
"city": "",
"state": "",
"zip_code": "",
"country": "",
"phone_number": "",
"account_type": "",
"account_status": "",
"account_balance": "",
```







#### TODO Backend: 
- implement a user registration system  ```call findAccount()``` (complete).
- implement a user authentication system.
- implement a user login system.
    - implement a user login history system to prevent session hijacking.
- implement a user logout system.
- implement a user profile system.
- implement a user payment system.
- implement a user payment history system.
- implement a user payment status system.
- implement a user payment type system.
- either implement a 3rd party payment gateway or implement a dummy payment gateway.
- move database to a cloud service like mongoDB for scalability.


#### TODO Frontend: 
- javascript(react.js) frontend.
