```payment_data api request to the server```
- ```payment_id (generated by the server and mapped to the user)```
- ```payment_amount```
- ```payment_date```
- ```payment_status```
- ```payment_type```
- ```payment_currency```

-- ```findAccount``` checks if the user exists in the database. In the future, this will be replaced by an actual database; not file storage.
